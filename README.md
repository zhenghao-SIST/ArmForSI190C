# ArmForSI190C

SI190C is a hands-on course offered every summer term, with its first session held in 2025. 
In that inaugural year, students worked on building a six-axis robotic arm. 
This project will continue over the coming years, with updates to both the content and code annually. 
This repository contains ROS2 code, primarily covering kinematics and communication modules.
